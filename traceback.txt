I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 125, in script
    "Well, \"patiently\" might have been giving me too much credit - Mira had a habit of running late, no matter how much I nagged her about it."
Exception: Trying to add something to non-existent layer 'mcspirte'.
